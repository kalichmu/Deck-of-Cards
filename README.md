# Deck-of-Cards

This repository implements a library representing a deck of playing cards.
A regular deck of cards consists of four suits (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades) and 13 cards in each 
suit (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) for a total of 52 cards (ignoring the jokers).

The following functionalities can be done with a deck of cards:
* Shuffle:  Randomizes the order of the cards.

* Cut:  Splits the deck at a point chosen by the player.
Cards above the split point are placed at the bottom of the deck (without reordering).
The first card below the split becomes the top of the deck.
The first card above the split becomes the bottom of the deck.

* Deal:  Retrieves the top card and removes it from the deck.

* Turn Over:  Retrieves the top card but does not remove it from the deck.

* Search:  Finds the position of a given card in the deck (top of the deck is the first card, next card
is the second, etc.).

* New Order:  Places the remaining cards in the deck in the order of a new deck of cards (top to bottom:
 hearts A-K, clubs A-K, diamonds K-A, spades K-A).
